# MENTAL-HEALTH-DETECTION-USING-ML
The system uses natural language processing (NLP) for text-based inputs (like social media posts or questionnaire responses) and machine learning classifiers (such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or SVM) to make accurate predictions. This project highlights the potential of AI in supporting mental well-being and early diagnosis.
